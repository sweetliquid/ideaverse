# Ideaverse Enrichment Skill

Use the ARC enrichment workflow to add new knowledge while maintaining consistency, detecting duplicates, and choosing appropriate structures. Assume familiarity with the core Ideaverse methodology.

## The ARC Enrichment Workflow

All knowledge enrichment follows the ARC pattern: **Add → Relate → Communicate**.

### Phase 1: ADD (Capture Without Friction)

```
1. Capture the raw information quickly
   ├── To daily log (if temporal)
   ├── To fleeting note (if needs processing)
   └── Direct to Atlas (if clearly permanent)

2. Include source attribution
   └── Where did this come from?

3. Don't organize yet
   └── Processing happens in RELATE phase
```

**Key principle**: Speed of capture matters. Don't let organization concerns prevent getting ideas into the system.

### Phase 2: RELATE (Connect & Integrate)

This is where enrichment quality is determined.

```
Step 2.1: Search Before Creating
    ↓
    ├── Search for existing notes on this concept
    ├── Check related MOCs for similar ideas
    └── If exists → Update existing note instead

Step 2.2: Classify Knowledge Type
    ↓
    ├── Concept? → Use concept extraction pattern
    ├── Process? → Use process documentation pattern
    ├── Entity? → Use entity profile pattern
    └── Principle? → Use principle articulation pattern

Step 2.3: Extract Atomic Notes
    ↓
    ├── One note per distinct concept
    ├── Keep notes focused and atomic
    └── Add proper frontmatter (up, related, created)

Step 2.4: Establish Connections
    ↓
    ├── Set up: property to relevant MOC
    ├── Add related: links to connected concepts
    ├── Add note to parent MOC
    └── Add back-links from related notes

Step 2.5: Validate Consistency
    ↓
    ├── Frontmatter complete?
    ├── Links working?
    └── No duplicates created?
```

### Phase 3: COMMUNICATE (Express & Use)

```
1. Use new knowledge in output
   ├── Reference in daily logs
   ├── Include in projects
   └── Build on for future work

2. Track completion
   └── Note in daily log that enrichment happened
```

## Knowledge Classification

Different types of knowledge require different structures. Classify before extracting.

### Type 1: Concepts

**What**: Abstract ideas, frameworks, mental models, theories

**Characteristics**:
- Stands alone as an idea
- Has relationships to other concepts
- Can be applied across domains

**Structure pattern**:
```markdown
# [Concept Name]

Brief definition in 1-2 sentences.

## Core Idea
What is this concept fundamentally about?

## Key Principles
- Principle 1
- Principle 2

## Connections
How does this relate to [[Related Concept]]?

## Applications
Where/when does this apply?

## Examples
Concrete instances of this concept.
```

**Use the prompt**: `ideaverse-enrichment-concepts.prompt`

### Type 2: Processes

**What**: Procedures, workflows, how-to knowledge, sequences

**Characteristics**:
- Has steps or phases
- Produces an outcome
- Can be followed repeatedly

**Structure pattern**:
```markdown
# [Process Name]

Brief description of what this process accomplishes.

## When to Use
Triggers or conditions for this process.

## Prerequisites
What's needed before starting?

## Steps
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. Step three

## Decision Points
If [condition], then [action].

## Common Variations
Alternative approaches when [situation].

## Failure Modes
What can go wrong and how to recover.
```

**Use the prompt**: `ideaverse-enrichment-processes.prompt`

### Type 3: Entities

**What**: People, organizations, tools, products, places

**Characteristics**:
- Specific instance, not abstract
- Has attributes and relationships
- Changes over time

**Structure pattern**:
```markdown
# [Entity Name]

Brief one-line description.

## Identity
What/who is this? Core attributes.

## Relationships
- Connected to [[Person/Org]]
- Uses [[Tool]]
- Part of [[System]]

## Context
Role, function, or purpose in your world.

## History
Key events, changes, timeline (if relevant).

## Notes
Additional observations.
```

**Use the prompt**: `ideaverse-enrichment-entities.prompt`

### Type 4: Principles

**What**: Rules, heuristics, guidelines, maxims

**Characteristics**:
- Prescriptive (tells you what to do)
- Has conditions of application
- May have exceptions

**Structure pattern**:
```markdown
# [Principle Name]

The principle stated clearly in one sentence.

## Definition
What does this principle mean in practice?

## When It Applies
Conditions where this principle is relevant.

## How to Apply
Practical guidance for using this principle.

## Counter-Examples
When does this NOT apply? What are the exceptions?

## Why It Matters
The reasoning behind this principle.

## Related Principles
- [[Similar Principle]]
- [[Contrasting Principle]]
```

**Use the prompt**: `ideaverse-enrichment-principles.prompt`

## Duplicate Detection

Before creating any new note, check for existing coverage.

### Search Strategy

**Preferred (when vault search tools are available):**

Use keyword search for exact title matching:
```bash
# Exact title/name match
qmd search "concept name"
```

Use semantic search for conceptual near-duplicates:
```bash
# Find notes discussing similar ideas, even with different titles
qmd query "what is [concept] and how does it apply"
```

Use graph tools to check existing coverage:
```bash
# Check what already links to related concepts
obsidian backlinks file="Related Concept"
```

**Fallback (any environment):**

```
1. Exact match search
   └── Search: [[concept name]]

2. Synonym search
   └── What other terms describe this?

3. MOC review
   └── Browse relevant MOC for similar concepts

4. Semantic scan
   └── What notes discuss related ideas?
```

### Duplicate Resolution

When a duplicate is found:

```
If new info < existing info:
    └── Add link to existing, don't create new

If new info supplements existing:
    └── Update existing note with new info

If notes are genuinely different:
    └── Create separate notes, add related: links

If unclear:
    └── Create new note, flag for later dedup review
```

### Merge Process

When consolidating duplicates:

```
1. Choose primary note (better structured/more complete)
2. Copy unique content from secondary to primary
3. Update links pointing to secondary → point to primary
4. Update MOCs to reference only primary
5. Delete secondary (or archive if uncertain)
```

## Enrichment Workflows

### Workflow: Article/Book Processing

```
1. Read/consume the source
    ↓
2. Capture key ideas to daily log
    - Use bullet points
    - Note source and page/location
    ↓
3. Identify distinct concepts (usually 2-5 per article)
    ↓
4. For each concept:
    a. Classify type (concept/process/entity/principle)
    b. Check for existing notes
    c. Create or update note
    d. Add to relevant MOC
    ↓
5. Create source note (optional)
    - Link to all extracted concepts
    - Add to Sources MOC
```

### Workflow: Experience Processing

```
1. Capture raw thoughts/observations
    ↓
2. Let it sit (optional - allows reflection)
    ↓
3. Identify the generalizable insight
    - What can I learn from this that applies elsewhere?
    ↓
4. Extract as principle or concept note
    ↓
5. Link to specific experience in daily log
```

### Workflow: Research Integration

```
1. Gather sources on topic
    ↓
2. Create temporary synthesis note
    - List all sources
    - Note key points from each
    ↓
3. Identify gaps in existing vault knowledge
    ↓
4. Create atomic notes to fill gaps
    ↓
5. Update relevant MOC with new structure
    ↓
6. Archive or keep synthesis note as overview
```

## Best Practices

### Quality Over Quantity
- Better to have 10 well-linked notes than 100 orphans
- Take time in the RELATE phase
- Verify connections are meaningful

### Source Attribution
- Always note where knowledge came from
- Makes future verification possible
- Helps trace your thinking

### Incremental Enrichment
- Don't try to capture everything at once
- Regular small additions beat occasional large dumps
- Let structure emerge naturally

### Validation Checklist

Before considering enrichment complete:
- [ ] Frontmatter has `up:` and `created:`
- [ ] Note added to relevant MOC
- [ ] At least one related: link if applicable
- [ ] No broken links introduced
- [ ] No duplicate created (or duplicates merged)
